# MyFirstBootstrapProject
I am a University Student trying out Bootstrap and Libraries.  I am going to customize the Bootstrap template and try and incorporate the Fabric.js Library.  I am now trying out the canvas.js chart library.  The library is easy to use and I have implemented it in my assignment HTML page using the bootstrap framework again.

My client brief is to visually show the client how his seasonal sales differenciate.  I am hoping that the client will be able to more easily see trends in his business and target his marketing campaigns more effectively.
